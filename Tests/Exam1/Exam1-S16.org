* Key ideas :no_export:
- pressure
- mass balance single
- mass balance multi-stage
- weight
- statistics
- density
- flow rates
- chemical compositions
- mixtures

* It all adds up (25 pts) label:Q:ideal
Two liquids are said to form an /ideal mixture/ if the volume of a mixture of the two is equal to the sum of the volumes of the individual components.  An ideal mixture has the property that:

\[ \frac{1}{\rho} = \sum_{i} \frac{x_{i}}{\rho_{i}} \]

\noindent where \(\rho\) is the density of the mixture, \(\rho_{i}\) is the density of component /i/, and \(x_{i}\) is the /mass fraction/ of component /i/.  Following is some data for mixtures of ethanol and hexane:

#+ATTR_LATEX: :align lcc
|-----------+--------------+------------------------|
|           | ethanol wt % | density (g/cm\(^{3}\)) |
|-----------+--------------+------------------------|
| Mixture 1 |         10.0 |                   0.68 |
| Mixture 2 |         90.0 |                   0.78 |
|-----------+--------------+------------------------|

** (10 pts) The gauge pressure at the bottom of a \SI{1.00}{\meter} tall drum of some ethanol/hexane mixture is \SI{7120}{\pascal}.  What is the density of the mixture?

\newpage
\noindent *Problem 1 continued*
** (15 pts) Estimate the composition (wt %) of the mixture in the drum, assuming ethanol and hexane form an ideal mixture.

\newpage
* All mixed up (45 pts)
Two liquid streams flow into a \SI{2000.}{\liter} tank.  One stream is
10.0%(w/w) ethanol and balance hexane, while the other is just the opposite,
10.0%(w/w) hexane in ethanol. The densities of these two streams is given in
Problem ref:Q:ideal. It takes 22 minutes for the two streams combined to fill
the tank.  When it is full, the tank is found to contain a 60.0%(w/w) ethanol
mixture with a density of \SI{0.74}{\grams\per\centimeter\cubed}.

** (10 pts) Make a sketch of this process, labeling all flows and compositions and identifying any unknowns by placing a box around them.
\vspace{10cm}
** (5 pts) Is this process steady-state or transient?
\vspace{1.5cm}
** (5 pts) What is the name of this type of process?
\vspace{1.5cm}
** (5 pts) Below is the general material balance expression.  Identify which terms are zero, which are non-zero, and the signs of the non-zero terms for the species in this process.

\newpage
\noindent *Problem 2 continued*
** (10 pts) Write down integral mass balance expressions for ethanol and for hexane.  Your mass balance expressions should have the same two unknowns as in your diagram above.
\vspace{10cm}
** (10 pts) Solve your mass balances for the two unknowns.
\newpage
* You gotta keep them separated (30 pts)
A 50% mixture by weight of ethanol and hexane is introduced continuously into a steady-state separator.  One outlet stream gets 60% (by weight) of the inlet ethanol and 50% of the inlet hexane while a second outlet contains the remainder of each.

** (10 pts) Make a sketch of this process, labeling all flows and compositions and identifying unknowns by drawing boxes around them. Assume an inlet basis of 100 kg/s.
\vspace{10cm}
** (5 pts) Count the number of unknowns and identify the equations and other pieces of information that relate them.  How many degrees of freedom does the system have?
\newpage
** (15 pts) Based on your degree of freedom analysis, determine all the flow rates and compositions that can be determined.
